            <section class="projectgallary_par1"><p>If the GIF is playing properly you should notice a red, black and white set of menus. These are the menus of Persona 5, a game released by company ATLAS on the PS4. The game was a smash hit, enough to despite releasing in 2017 a re-release was made only 3 years later. Part of that would be for it's UI. The way different menus transition is creative and gives intrest to even scrolling through spells. The colors of white and black contrast making it easy to read despite what is going on while the red grabs your attention. The trippy patterns and the simple background line work could make anything a joy to read. This catches my attention for design like this can be translated into a website to make it stand out. It shows that the right design can make or break your idea and this one made it.</p></section>

            <section class="projectgallary_par2"><p>Stardew Valley is video game developed by Eric Barone(ConcernedApe) and published by Chucklefish. The game is fun yes, but the thing I find more impressive is the fact that the game was developed as a solo project. This means all the music, graphics and code was done by one person. The amount of work and dedication required to do this is insane and his versitile set of both logical and artistic skills are on display. Now the game went from a small PC release to being released on popular consoles like the Nintendo Switch or the PS4 getting getting millions of sales. Projects like this is motivational and shows that if one puts their mind to their craft they can make great things.</p></section>

            <section class="projectgallary_par3"><p>Raytracing is possibly one of the greater graphical improvements in some time. Ray tracing is an accurate way of tracking light and shadows by keeping track of specific rays of simulated light. It was used in cinema to make CGI more belivable and only now started to be used with games. A few example of this is the recent RTX version of Minecraft, Control and many others. Ray tracing is an interesting concept and gets me exited for technological improvements.</p></section>

            <section class="projectgallary_par4"><p>The Ambassador is a project developed by Waverly Labs meant to translate any language on the fly into your mother tongue. It can translate what you say and then send a transition of that to your smartphone to play on speakers. With these functions you could technically have a full conversation with somebody even if you don't know eachother's languages. This shows how tech can be used for great things and how far we have progressed.</p></section>
