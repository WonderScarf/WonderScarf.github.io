                <p> Hello, my name is Tyler Messina-Katunar and I'm a 1st year student at John Abbott college. My goal is to became a good enough programer to make a game that will be remembered forever. My focus and intrest is in programing. As of now I am confident in C# and Python. I also know a bunch about game design, pixel art and team management from past projects.</p>
                <p> I currently live in Montreal with my family and our two Saint Bernards, Jax and Toby. I don't have any prefered foods as I don't find any fun in eating like many others. I've been taking care of animals since I was little and I collect shiny rocks.</p>
